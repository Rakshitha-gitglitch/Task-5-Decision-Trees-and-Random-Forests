# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests (Heart Disease Dataset)

## Objective
Learn tree-based models for classification & regression using Scikit-learn.

## Steps Done
1. Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier**
2. Visualized the tree (`decision_tree.png`)
3. Controlled tree depth to reduce overfitting
4. Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** and compared accuracy
5. Plotted **Feature Importances** (`feature_importances.png`)
6. Evaluated models using **cross-validation**
7. Plotted **Confusion Matrix** for Random Forest

## Results
- Decision Tree Accuracy: ~ (varies by run)
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~ (higher, more stable)
- Random Forest outperformed Decision Tree and showed most important features.
